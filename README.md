# Bifacial Power Estimator

## Project Overview

This project aims to estimate the power production of bifacial solar modules using the view factor technique. It focuses particularly on varying climate conditions, including snow coverage, which can significantly impact the power output of bifacial modules. The project includes utilities such as the typical meteorological year (TMY) data and power forecasting tools.

## Key Features

**View Factor Technique**: Employs the view factor method to accurately estimate power production from bifacial modules.  
**Climate Adaptability**: Considers different climate conditions, with a special focus on scenarios involving snow coverage.  
**Meteorological Data Integration**: Novel approach to generate the TMY(Typical Meteorological Year) using principal component Analysis.  
**Power Forecasting**: Using the forecasted meteorological data from Solcast this tool can be used to accurately forecast the power production of bifacial modules.
