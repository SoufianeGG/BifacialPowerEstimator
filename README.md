# Bifacial Power Estimator

## Project Overview

This project aims to estimate the power production of bifacial solar modules using the view factor technique. It focuses particularly on varying climate conditions, including snow coverage, which can significantly impact the power output of bifacial modules. The project includes utilities such as the typical meteorological year (TMY) data and power forecasting tools.

## Key Features

**View Factor Technique**: Employs the view factor method to accurately estimate power production from bifacial modules.  
**Climate Adaptability**: Considers different climate conditions, with a special focus on scenarios involving snow coverage.  
**Meteorological Data Integration**: Utilizes typical meteorological year (TMY) data to provide realistic weather conditions for power estimation.  
**Power Forecasting**: Includes tools for forecasting power production based on historical and real-time data.
